- This is my final year academic project
- here, we have tried to detect the presence of water on floor and upon detection a message is being sent to a telegram bot using openCV python.
- using thresholding on image feed from camera to trace out the contours and further filteration.
- Limitation:
- Further fileteration and training is necessary for more precison of detection.
